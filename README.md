# Coin-Tossing
Write an app that simulates coin tossing. Let the app toss a coin each time the user chooses the “Toss Coin” menu option. Count the number of times each side of the coin appears. Display the results. The app should call a separate method Flip that takes no arguments and returns false for tails and true for heads. (Note: If the app realistically simulates coin tossing, each side of the coin should appear approximately half the time.)
